QML for Sublime Text 1.6.0 has been released!

This minor version brings some quality-of-life improvements:

- more hardcoded enum names from the standard library,
- new: support for explicit enum values (numeric literals),
- new: support for type casting `as` operator, which is a QML Engine's
  extension to JavaScript syntax.
- new: support for the newer pragma syntax like this:

    pragma ValueTypeBehavior: Copy, Addressable

- allow `void` and arbitrary gadget names for properties and function
  signatures.
- keeping up with upstream changes to the JavaScript package.
