QML for Sublime Text 1.0 has been released!

Enjoy the complete rewrite of a syntax highlighter which is now so featureful
and robust that it's fully capable of parsing even the most bizarre snippets
with lesser known QML constructs. Use the built-in GoTo Definition action to
locate objects by their id, property declarations and inline components!

Additionally,
 - all built-in enum values from QtQml, QtQuick, QtQuick.Dialogs and
   QtQuick.Controls, such as Text.AlignHCenter or StandardButton.Cancel are
   highlighted with a special different color,
 - signal handlers (including those defined as methods in Connections) are
   parsed, stripped from 'on' prefix and 'Changed' suffix (if any) such that
   some color schemes display the middle part (the actual property/signal
   name) as underlined or as different color.
