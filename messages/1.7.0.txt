QML for Sublime Text 1.7.0 has been released!

Added new snippets for common pragma names & values. Just start
typing "pragma" outside of the top-level object declaration.

A brand new command allows converting between property names and their change
signal handlers! Try now, put a cursor on the words below, open command
palette, and find "QML: Convert Between Property And Signal Handler" entry:

    position:
           <->
    onPositionChanged:

It comes without any shortcut by default, so you might want to edit your keymap:

    {
        "command": "convert_between_property_and_signal_handler",
        "keys": ["ctrl+alt+shift+s"],
        "context": [
            {
                "key": "selector",
                "operator": "equal",
                "operand": "source.qml"
            }
        ]
    }
